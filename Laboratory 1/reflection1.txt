The most useful design principle for me was using Templates and Styles, because they
helped maintain consistency, repetition, and unity throughout the slides. Canva’s
alignment tools and guides were the easiest to use, as they made arranging elements
precise and clean. The hardest part was choosing the right visuals from the uploads and
media library without overcrowding the layout. Through this process, I learned that
visual communication becomes more effective when designs are consistent and
well-organized. A clear visual hierarchy helps guide the viewer’s attention smoothly
across the content. Overall, this activity taught me that structure and simplicity play a
big role in delivering a strong message
