The square post featuring a quote was the easiest design to create because the layout
was simple and focused, allowing me to highlight the text clearly. I applied my personal
branding elements, including my brand colors, chosen typefaces, and logo, to maintain
consistency across the graphic. I ensured readability by using contrasting colors for the
background and text, while applying visual hierarchy by making the quote the largest
element, the author slightly smaller, and any additional text minimal. Careful spacing
and alignment helped the text look organized and professional. I learned that simplicity
often strengthens impact, especially when conveying a message or inspiration in a
small, social media–friendly format. I also realized that consistency in branding builds
recognition and makes graphics look cohesive across platforms. Overall, creating this
graphic taught me how to balance creativity with clarity while designing visually
appealing content for digital media.
