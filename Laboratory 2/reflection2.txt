My personal branding was inspired by my passion for design, creativity, and visual
storytelling. I wanted it to reflect both my architectural focus and my interest in graphic
and layout design. I chose my color palette based on soft, muted tones that feel
modern, approachable, and cohesive, while also giving a calm and professional
aesthetic. The most challenging part of creating the logo was balancing simplicity with
personality, making sure it looked clean while still representing who I am. I also wanted
the logo to be versatile enough to work across different platforms and formats. I plan to
use this branding in future projects, portfolios, and presentations to maintain a
consistent and recognizable professional identity. Overall, this process taught me how
intentional design choices can communicate personality and professionalism effectively
